8. Design & UI/UX Guidelines
•	Aesthetic: Clean, modern, professional, and trustworthy.
•	Information Hierarchy: Prioritize clarity. Guide the user's attention to the most important information and actions.
•	Consistency: Uniform use of colors, typography (sans-serif fonts like Inter or similar), spacing, and interactive elements across all modules.
•	Component Library: Utilize Shadcn UI (built with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI) for all UI components to ensure consistency and development speed.
•	Navigation: Intuitive and predictable site navigation. Minimize clicks for common actions.
•	Feedback: Provide clear visual feedback for user actions (e.g., loading states, success messages, error messages, validation feedback).
•	Responsiveness: Ensure a good experience on standard desktop screen sizes. Prioritize graceful degradation on smaller viewports if full mobile optimization is out of scope for MVP.
9. Technical Stack & Architecture
•	9.1. Architecture: 
o	Initial Approach: Modular Monolith. This provides a good balance of development speed and organized structure for MVP. Ensure strong internal API boundaries between modules to facilitate potential future migration to microservices if needed.
o	Focus on clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and distinct service modules within the monolith.
•	9.2. Frontend: 
o	Framework: React (with Vite or Next.js - specify if one is preferred).
o	UI Components: Shadcn UI.
o	State Management: (e.g., Zustand, Jotai, Redux Toolkit - AI can choose or you can specify).
o	Styling: Tailwind CSS (as per Shadcn UI).
•	9.3. Backend: 
o	Language/Runtime: Node.js.
o	Framework: (e.g., Express.js, NestJS - specify if one is preferred. NestJS offers more structure which can be good for modular monoliths).
o	API: RESTful API (document with OpenAPI v3).
•	9.4. Database: 
o	Primary Application Database (for users, settings, automation rules, etc.): PostgreSQL (Recommended for its robustness, scalability, and compatibility with NocoDB).
o	Data Management Module Backend (Module 2): NocoDB. 
	Clarification: SMB OS will embed or tightly integrate with NocoDB, using it as the engine for the "Unified Databases" module. Users will interact with a UI built with Shadcn components that, in turn, controls and configures NocoDB instances/projects. NocoDB itself will use PostgreSQL (or another supported SQL database like MySQL, configured for it) as its own backend to store the data managed by the users within Module 2.
•	9.5. AI Agent: 
o	LLM Integration: Specify target LLM provider(s) and models (e.g., OpenAI API with gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4, Anthropic Claude API).
o	Orchestration: Backend service to handle NLU, context management, and interaction with internal SMB OS APIs.
•	9.6. Deployment (Initial Thoughts - AI to determine best practices): 
o	Containerization (Docker).
o	Cloud Platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure - specify if preference or leave to AI's discretion).
o	CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
10. Success Metrics & KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
•	User Engagement: 
o	Daily Active Users (DAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU).
o	Average session duration.
o	Feature adoption rate (e.g., % of users creating automations, % of users using AI agent).
•	Task Completion & System Usage: 
o	Number of automations created and run successfully.
o	Number of databases/records created.
o	Number of third-party integrations connected.
•	User Satisfaction: 
o	Net Promoter Score (NPS) (Post-launch surveys).
o	Customer Support Ticket volume and resolution time.
•	System Performance: 
o	Adherence to NFR_01 (Performance targets).
o	Uptime (NFR_05).
11. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)
•	Advanced analytics and reporting dashboards.
•	More complex automation triggers and actions (e.g., multi-step automations, conditional logic branching).
•	Expanded library of third-party integrations.
•	Native mobile applications (iOS, Android).
•	Marketplace for user-created database templates or automation recipes.
•	Enhanced AI capabilities (e.g., proactive suggestions, data analysis).
•	Team collaboration features (e.g., commenting, shared views with finer-grained permissions).
•	Public API (FEAT_SYS_07).
•	Advanced data import/export options.
12. Out of Scope (for MVP)
•	Full mobile application development (basic mobile web viewing is desirable).
•	Advanced business intelligence (BI) and data visualization tools beyond basic views.
•	Direct E-commerce platform integration (e.g., Shopify, WooCommerce) beyond generic data sync.
•	HR-specific modules like payroll or detailed leave management (beyond simple tracking in a custom database).
•	Multi-language support beyond English for UI (though architecture should allow for it).
•	On-premise deployment.
13. Assumptions
•	The AI Coding Assistant can interpret these requirements to generate functional code.
•	Users will have stable internet access.
•	The selected LLMs for the AI Agent will be accessible via API and perform adequately.
•	NocoDB can be successfully integrated as the backend for Module 2 as described.
